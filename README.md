# Accessibility Quiz

## Quiz made on FreeCodeCamp to learn about accessibility and SEO

### In this course I better understood these concepts:
    - `<meta name="description" content="page description">` it’s used for accessibility and SEO.
    - SVG contains the attribute of `path`, which can allow you to resize the image without affecting resolution;>
    - `min()` property works similar to `width` and `max-width`. `min()` property works similar to width and max-width
    - `>` selects a direct children of an element;
    - `role` can be used to indicate purpose of an element on the page to assistive technologies;
    - `aria-labelledby` can be used to reference another element to define it’s accessible name. The `aria-label` should be used if there’s no content that can be referenced to use a accessible name;
    - accesskey it’s used to provide keyboard shortcuts.

### Conclusion
    In this course I realized how important is semantic HTML, using suitable tags in your code can contribute a lot for accessibility on your web page, attributes like `aria-labelledby` and `role` are some of them.
    My current goal is to master React, but first I need to complete some begginer courses on FreeCodeCamp.
